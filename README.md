# Gmail Autoreply Application
  This Node.js app automates vacation email responses for a Gmail account. It checks for new emails, sends replies to first-time threads, adds a label, and repeats the process randomly every 45 to 120 seconds. Authentication is handled through the "Login with Google" API, utilizing Google's Gmail API for seamless interactions.
